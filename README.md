# 🖼️ Imango
Imango is a pure-C image processing library focused on manual/hybrid content-based image recognition. Built entirely from scratch with no external dependencies, it implements core computer vision algorithms with full control and transparency.

> **Note:** ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a demonstration project. It is not optimized for production use and should not be relied on for performance-critical applications.
Imango supports only BMP image files, and no other formats will be added.  

### ✨ Features
## Canny Edge Detection ##
Implements the full pipeline:

Grayscale conversion

Gaussian blur

Sobel edge detection

Non-maximum suppression

Hysteresis thresholding

```c
applyCanny("image.bmp");
```
## Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection ##
Detects strong corners using the structure tensor method:

```c
applyCorner("image.bmp");
```

## Blob Detection (Difference of Gaussians) ##
Detects image regions of interest based on scale-space extrema:

```c
applyBlob("image.bmp");
```

## Each function accepts a const char* filename (must be a .bmp file).##

### 🧠 Usage Guide
## 🔧 Build ##
```bash
make
```
This will compile the library and place the executable in the build/ directory.

▶️ Running the Demo
To test the algorithms:

```bash
cd build
./main "relative/path/to/image.bmp" 3 1
```
Arguments:

"image.bmp" — relative path to a BMP image file.

3 — Gaussian kernel width (must be odd).

1 — Standard deviation for Gaussian blur.

You can change the default kernel parameters to tune image smoothing and feature detection sensitivity.

### 🧰 Additional Functions
All header files in the include/ directory expose lower-level functions for:

## Custom kernel generation ##

## Pixel-level operations ##

## Manual access to image buffers and intermediate stages ##

You can use these to construct your own image processing pipeline or customize behavior beyond the default demos.
